Tablut was one of a family of 'tafl' board games played by the Vikings, Anglo-Saxons and other ancient peoples of northern Europe. Although the rules are fairly simple, the game involves considerable strategic skill.

It is played on a 9 x 9 board between two unequal sides: the attackers (Black) have sixteen pieces, while the defenders (White) have eight ordinary pieces, plus a King.

Other tafl games use various different boards and configurations of pieces, but all have in common a 2:1 ratio between attackers and defenders. The goal for the defending side is always for the King to escape by reaching the edge of the board, while the attackers attempt to surround him.

The precise rules of tafl games as they were played in ancient times are a matter for speculation. In its simplest form the game is highly asymmetrical, with a heavy advantage for White. Additional rules are necessary to even up the stakes, such as an unarmed King (unable to capture) and the ability to capture against the shaded squares of the board. In many variants of the game, the King must reach the corner of the board, not just the edge.

Tablut largely disappeared after the arrival of chess in northern Europe in the 12th century, but the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus saw it played on a reindeer skin board in Lapland as late as 1732. In a nod to current events, the Lapps called the two sides 'Swedes' and 'Muscovites' - the Muscovites being the attackers.
